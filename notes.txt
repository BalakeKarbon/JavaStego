Testing with nums.py output for filling bike.png:
1 bit full encode:
	decode fails at last byte printed 766531
	Swapping getWidth for getHeight increased that to 1039131 ish.
	191706 of 223657. missing 31951
2 bit full encode:
	decode fails at last byte printed 1548934:
	SWP->2094135	
4 bit full encode:
	decode fails at last byte printed 3113741
	SWP->4204149
8 bit full encode:
	decode fails at last byte printed 6250740
	SWP->8476985
The relationship between these is exponential as they double every bit introduced. This means for all of these it is failing at the same point

9846720 iterations with all enabled. WHICH IS CORRECT ENTIRE IMAGE FOR Bike.png

But somehow were only setting the secretDataByteIndex up to 318037 before it exits loop?
